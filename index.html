Children are oriented towards multimedia classes, teaching is given using multimedia aids and most of the classrooms are designed to deliver the lectures digitally. The benefit of multimedia learning is that it takes advantage of the brain’s ability to make connections between verbal and visual representations of content, leading to a deeper understanding, which in turn supports the transfer of learning to other situations. In a multimedia learning environment, students can identify and solve problems more easily compared to the scenario where teaching is made possible only by textbooks. It is always easier if you teach the kids digitally and practically, how something happens rather than explaining the process to them.</p>
